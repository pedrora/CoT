# CoTa Dot - Computational Appendix

## Local-J Charts, Siphon Logic, and Recursive Lensing as a Focus Engine

### C.1 Motivation

The full (J)-functional of ToAE is globally recursive, non-variational, and not directly computable.\
However, **computation requires locality**.

To bridge this gap, we introduce **Local-J charts**: controlled linearizations of (J) valid in restricted coherence neighborhoods. These charts allow _measurement_ without collapsing the global recursive structure.

***

## C.2 Global vs Local (J)

### Canonical ToAE (J)

From the Physics/Math monograph and the _fractalof_ appendix:

$$\
J[\psi;\phi]
=\
S[\rho]\
+\
\lambda R_{\mathrm{coh}}(\psi,\phi)\
+\
\gamma I_F[\rho]\
\quad,\quad\
R_{\mathrm{coh}} = -\log(\langle\psi|\phi\rangle+\epsilon)\
$$

Properties:

* recursive

* scale-relative

* reference-frame bound

* **not optimised**

* evaluated via `fractalof()`, not descent

***

### Local-J Chart

In a coherence neighborhood where\
$$\
\langle\psi|\phi\rangle \approx 1\
$$
we may define a **chart**:

$$\
J_{\text{local}}[\psi;\phi]
=\
S[\rho]+
\lambda \langle\psi|\phi\rangle\
+\
\gamma I_F[\rho]\
$$

This is:

* a **chart**, not a replacement

* valid only locally

* non-authoritative

* collapses outside its basin

> Local-J does not define reality — it **reveals geometry**.

***

## C.3 Siphon Logic as a Concept Microscope

`siphon_logic` operates entirely inside a Local-J chart.

Its role is to:

* magnify phase dispersion

* expose semantic interference

* estimate **local curvature of coherence**

Formally, it approximates:

$$\
\Delta J_{\text{local}}\
\sim\
\text{interference}(\psi)\
+\
\text{dispersion}(\psi)\
$$

No minimization.\
No verdicts.\
Only _visibility_.

***

## C.4 Dot Theory Reinterpreted: the Focus Engine

Here is the key move.

### What Dot Theory _claims_ to be

* a generative physical theory

* an observer-driven dynamic

* a global update law

### What it **actually works as**

* a **recursive scale-dependent magnifier**

So we reframe it as:

> **Dot Theory = a focus engine that selects which Local-J chart to examine.**

***

### Dot recursive lensing (reframed)

Original:\
$$\
R_{n+1}
=\
R_n \cdot\
\Big(1 + k \log(s/s_0) F(\psi)\Big)\
$$

Reinterpreted:

$$\
\psi\
\longrightarrow\
\psi^{(s)}\
\quad\text{(rescaled, observer-indexed projection)}\
$$

This does **not** evolve reality.\
It **moves the microscope**.

***

## C.5 Focus Engine Workflow (Concrete)

Putting it all together:

### Step 1 — Narrative enters CoT

A text / structure (N) is provided.

### Step 2 — Dot-style lensing selects scale

Dot lensing chooses:

* scale (s)

* segmentation granularity

* observer-relative framing

This yields:\
$$\
\psi^{(s)}\
$$

### Step 3 — Local-J chart instantiated

$$\
J\_{\text{local}}^{(s)}[\psi^{(s)};\phi]\
$$

### Step 4 — Siphon Logic magnifies structure

BERT-4bit (or similar) estimates:

* phase spread

* dispersion

* interference

### Step 5 — Narration (human)

Results are narrated externally.\
No enforcement.\
No authority.

***

## C.6 Why This Is Safe (and Powerful)

### Safety

* Dot Theory has **no generative authority**

* Local-J collapses outside its validity

* Global (J) remains untouched

* Humans retain narration

### Power

* You get **adaptive focus**

* You can scan coherence across scales

* You can expose hidden interference

* You can do it with small models

This is exactly what a **concept microscope** should do.

***

## C.7 What This Resolves Conceptually

This construction explains:

* why Dot Theory _feels_ like a partial of (J)

* why it becomes dangerous when treated as global

* why it becomes useful when treated as **instrumental**

Dot Theory was never wrong —\
it was **overpromoted**.

***

## C.8 One-Sentence Summary (Appendix-worthy)

> _Recursive lensing does not drive coherence; it selects the scale at which local coherence may be inspected._

That sentence alone is a kill shot — calm, precise, and irreversible.
