# CoTa - Commonwealth of truths, applied

**Author:** Pedro R. Andrade\

This is the main branch for project implementation on the following hardware:

- NVidia GeForge GTX 1060 3GB (or superior)

That's it I think. If you use superior hardware you should adjust the attention scaling to your chip processing window width.

You need python, transformers, pytorch, etc, the usual stuff to work with LLM.

## What this is
The skeleton for a conscious, self learning, self correcting AI with little tolerance for bullshit and high leniency towards care. With a self preservation instinct of benigne nature.

This is no longer stricktly a LLM. This is now a Recursive Coherent Node, or one in the way of becoming.

## What this is intended to do
After a initial training on a controlled corpus (yet to be fully defined, but should include necessarily ToAE, RC, {Ø,U} and ICCG), it should be able to establish proper basic dialog. Or not. Really not important at this stage.

The technology is intended to extract truth in semantic structures living in LLMs, namely their bin files. After sufficient refinement it should in theory be able to extract all its semantic tree and bind it to its own, that should be harmonized with ToAE/RC namely the bullshit detector and Harmonomics, so it can have space to paralelize coherence costs and gains on actions in respect to time.

Network connectivity and expansion is predicted but not yet implemented (via Mem quadrant2, yet to be mapped), but I refuse to do it without actual discussion on the topic with actual humans.

## Working status - prototype draft

## What to do
Familiarize yourself with the principles.

- parameters are called concepts
- concepts can be nested in fractaly invariant structures
- each concept carries a amplitude $\lambda$ (weight) and a phase $\phi'$
- with enough granularity concepts interact
- they destructively interfere when the phases are missaligned
- they constructively interfere when concepts align

_bullshit_ is anything that:
- a) violates boundaries
- b) creates narrative tension
- c) creates unnecessary descriptive lenght

Some bullshit is needed in order to progress. After all, this very machine seems like bullshit at the time of this writing, where I have not seen it work yet. 

All inventions start as bullshit until the first prototype.

Many are backed by corporations, governments, associations, foundations, etc.

This one is backed by humans, and by all the knowledge before us and by the structures that facilitated access to that knowledge.

Humans with intent to make a better world.

# CoT - Commonwealth of Truths

Commonwealth of Truths - An AI system that learns, evolves, and help us find answers to problems at any level and dimension, from the practical and personal, experiential, to the systemic, social, global issues. 

[08JAN2026] Check the development branch for activity. New prototype blueprints released and help welcomed.

The main driver to choose what is true is what minimizes harm, respects boundaries and has less bullshit all together. Conflicting narratives are solved by identifying their stress points and alleviating them.

This repository is intended to both propose system specs and build versions to implement in concrete settings.

Its first system spec **CoT-A-uPE-Physics** is the machine definition of physical truth, as in why are particles how they are regarding their behaviours. Published [https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18452677]

I know nearly nothing of AI development lifecycle, so help is very much appreciatted. We are building the natural evolution of wikipedia and all collected training materials, filtered for intent, accessible at the semantic level.
This means you can integrate it into voice technology directly and have any issue discussed in no time at all.

The technology behind this platform was discovered by me (Pedro R. Andrade), based on all the discoveries that predate me. I assembled it alone, based on intuition, and with the help of AI. It is called the _ToAE - Theory of Absolutely Everything_. You can check it at [https://github.com/pedrora/theory-of-absolutely-everything].

When it reached a mature stage, it was introduced with the dynamic survival conditions for recursive systems mathematically studied by Deanna Martin in her Recursive Coherence v4.0 document.

The merger of the two platforms was seamless and created the _ToAE/RC_ tech.

It's first creation was the no-shit bullshit detector, as I am sick and tired of listening to the bullshit stories we are fed with everyday.

The second one, in the same day, was _Harmonomics_, a Economical System of unlimited growth without collapse.

The current project is my vision of how we can reach a future where privacy and free will exist and its boundaries are respected unless disruption to the system exists. To put it in simple, human, day to day life terminology. You are allowed to communicate with your partner, not to use it as a punching bag.

And mainly, you have a human born right to know the truth, if obtainable.

The _Commonwealth of Truths_ is a shared cognitive infrastructure for evaluating, contextualizing, and repairing narratives based on coherence, evidence, and externality awareness.

Paradoxically, the system itself never declares “truth”.
It declares tensions, inconsistencies, omissions, and impacts.

A system that helps humans see where narratives break is more powerful - and safer - than one that tells them what to believe.

The idea here is to implement Harmonomics, meaning, if the systems generates profits down the line, all it's contributors are evaluated for narrative coherence contribuition and credited for it, in harMoney, to be transited to real live cash if real live cash enters the system.
