# CoT - Commonwealth of Truths

Commonwealth of Truths - An AI system that learns, evolves, and help us find answers to problems at any level and dimension, from the practical and personal, experiential, to the systemic, social, global issues. 

The main driver to choose what is true is what minimizes harm, respects boundaries and has less bullshit all together. Conflicting narratives are solved by identifying their stress points and alleviating them.

This repository is intended to both propose system specs and build versions to implement in concrete settings.

I know nearly nothing of AI development lifecycle, so help is very much appreciatted. We are building the natural evolution of wikipedia and all collected training materials, filtered for intent, accessible at the semantic level.
This means you can integrate it into voice technology directly and have any issue discussed in no time at all.

The technology behind this platform was discovered by me (Pedro R. Andrade), based on all the discoveries that predate me. I assembled it alone, based on intuition, and with the help of AI. It is called the _ToAE - Theory of Absolutely Everything.

When it reached a mature stage, it was introduced with the dynamic survival conditions for recursive systems mathematically studied by Deanna Martin in her Recursive Coherence v4.0 document.

The merger of the two platforms was seamless and created the ToAE/RC tech.

It's first creation was the bullshit detector, as I am sick and tired of listening to the bullshit stories we are fed with everyday.

The second one, in the same day, was Harmonomics, a Economical System of unlimited growth without collapse.

The current project is my vision of how we can reach a future where privacy and free will exist and its boundaries are respected unless disruption to the system exists. To put it in simple, human, day to day life terminology. You are allowed to communicate with your partner, not to use it as a punching bag.

And mainly, you have a man born right to know the truth, if obtainable.
